<h3>Heartstopper (TV series)</h3>
<p>
  The story of two British teens, Nick Nelson and Charlie Spring, at an all-boys
  grammar school. Charlie, a high-strung, openly gay overthinker, and Nick, a
  cheerful, soft-hearted rugby player, one day are made to sit together in
  class. Their friendship quickly becomes something more for openly gay Charlie,
  but he initially does not believe he has a chance with Nick, but love works in
  surprising ways, with Nick more interested in Charlie than either of them
  realized. Heartstopper is about love, friendship, and loyalty. It encompasses
  all the small stories of Nick and Charlie's lives that together make something
  larger.

<h3>Love, Simon</h3>
<p>
  A young coming-of-age tale about a teenage boy, Simon Spier, goes through a
  different kind of Romeo and Juliet story. Simon has a love connection with a
  boy, Blue, by email, but the only problem is that Simon has no idea who he's
  talking to. Simon must discover who that boy is--who Blue is. Along the way,
  he tries to find himself as well.

<h3>Brokeback Mountain</h3>
<p>
